Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.\r\n\r\nApplications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.', 'about-bg.jpg', '2025-01-19 15:14:11'),

Since 2018, Flask-related data and objects can be rendered with Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nFlask has become popular among Python enthusiasts. As of October 2020, it has the second-most number of stars on GitHub among Python web-development frameworks, only slightly behind Django,[14] and was voted the most popular web framework in the Python Developers Survey for years between and including 2018 and 2022', 'about-bg.jpg', '2025-01-19 15:14:11'),

Werkzeug can instantiate objects for request, response, and utility functions. It can be used as the basis for a custom software framework and supports Python 2.7 and 3.5 and later.[20][21]\r\n\r\nJinja\r\nMain article: Jinja (template engine)\r\nJinja, also by Ronacher, is a template engine for the Python programming language. Similar to the Django web framework, it handles templates in a sandbox.\r\n\r\nMarkupSafe\r\nMarkupSafe is a string handling library for the Python programming language. The eponymous MarkupSafe type extends the Python string type and marks its contents as \"safe\"; combining MarkupSafe with regular strings automatically escapes the unmarked strings, while avoiding double escaping of already marked strings.\r\n\r\nItsDangerous\r\nItsDangerous is a safe data serialization library for the Python programming language.
